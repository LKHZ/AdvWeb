	<p>Newly-married country singer RaeLynn isn't spending her Memorial Day weekend relaxing with her new hubby. Instead, the 22-year-old is performing at Camp NASH to benefit The Special Forces Charitable Trust.</p>

	<p>"I have a special connection with the special forces because my brother is in the special forces and he's been serving for a little bit now," RaeLynn told FOX411 Country. "It's such an amazing sacrifice for any family that has somebody in any part of the military, and I just love to give back and be a voice for that because I know what it feels like to have my brother miss out on birthdays, Christmases. My brother wasn't at my wedding and it's definitely hard."</p>

	<p>This isn't the first time the "God Made Girls" singer has given back to those in the military and their families; in 2014 she sang the national anthem at the 51st annual Wreath Laying Ceremony that honored President JFK and the men and women of the special forces at the Arlington National Cemetery.</p>

	<p>"My mom got invited to go to the memorial because of my brother and it was just incredible honoring all of the Green Berets but the whole time I was there I kept thinking that my brother would... be so jealous that I was meeting all of these military bigwigs."</p>

	<p>After "The Voice" alum performed, her brother came out and surprised her.</p>

	<p>"I just screamed because I hadn't seen him in almost a little over a year and me and my brother are so close. I just started bawling and hugging him. I had to leave really early for a show the next day, but I didn't even go to sleep."</p>

	<p>RaeLynn will have to make sure she gets enough sleep come this fall because she is going on tour with her former "Voice" coach Blake Shelton.</p>

	<p>"I hit the road with Blake this fall and I'm working on a record right now," RaeLynn revealed. "We've just been hashing this record out. I'm just so excited about it. It's just a really special thing for me and dear to my heart every song on it is not taken for granted."</p>
