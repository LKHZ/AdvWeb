              <p> Khloe Kardashian is once again seeking to end her marriage to former NBA player Lamar Odom.</p>
	<p>Court records in Los Angeles show Kardashian filed for divorce Thursday, citing irreconcilable differences.</p>

	<p>The reality TV star and Odom married in September 2009, and she filed to divorce him in December 2013, which she still lists as their date of separation. The divorce was never finalized and Kardashian withdrew the petition after Odom was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel last year. She cited Odom's medical condition as one reason to withdraw the divorce.</p>

	<p>Odom was hospitalized in critical condition in Las Vegas in October 2015 after he was found unconscious with cocaine and other drugs in his system. After months of recovery, he returned to the public eye in February at a Kanye West fashion show.</p>

	<p>The divorce filing states Kardashian and Odom have a prenuptial agreement. They have no children together.</p>

	<p>Odom played most of his NBA career with the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers.</p>

	<p>Kardashian's "Kocktails with Khloe" talk show ended last month after 14 episodes. Kim Kardashian-West's younger sister also appears on "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" and published a book last year called "Strong Looks Better Naked."</p>
