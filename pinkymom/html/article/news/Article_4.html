            <p>BOSTON (AP) â€” Gov. Charlie Baker wants to devote more than $1 billion to affordable housing over the next five years with the goal of preserving or creating 5,000 affordable units.</p>
            <p>
             The Republican said Monday his capital plan for Massachusetts will include $1.1 billion for housing.

            </p>
            <p>
                Baker says the proposal will support existing housing programs and also finance efforts to maintain affordable housing that is at risk of flipping to market rate.
            </p>
            <p>Under his proposal, investments in public and affordable housing would increase by eight percent in the 2017 fiscal year that begins July 1 and 18 percent over the course of the plan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Baker says it would help local housing authorities and encourage the private construction of affordable housing.
                
            </p>
            <p>The plan comes as Massachusetts faces a housing squeeze due to high demand.
