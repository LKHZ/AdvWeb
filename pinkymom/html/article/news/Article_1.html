        <h1> Donald Trump: London mayor made 'very rude statements' about me</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="modal_text">
            <p>Donald Trump said Monday London's new mayor made "very rude statements" about him -- and the presumptive Republican presidential nominee warned he won't have a good relationship with British Prime Minister David Cameron if he's elected.
            </p>
            <p>
               Trump made the comments in an interview with ITV's "Good Morning Britain" host Piers Morgan, when asked to respond to criticisms made about him by British politicians.

            </p>
            <p>
                Trump's comments on Islam have provoked an outcry in the UK, and prompted parliamentarians to debate a proposal to ban him from the country for hate speech after a petition to do so attracted more than 500,000 signatures.
            </p>
            <p>Asked about Cameron's remarks, Trump said he didn't care, but then added, "It looks like we're not going to have a very good relationship. Who knows, I hope to have a good relationship with him but it sounds like he's not willing to address the problem either."

            </p>
            <p>He continued: "Number one, I'm not stupid, okay? I can tell you that right now. Just the opposite. Number two, in terms of divisive, I don't think I'm a divisive person, I'm a unifier, unlike our president now, I'm a unifier."
            A spokeswoman for Cameron said he had made his views on Trump's "Muslim ban" proposal clear and had "nothing further to add."
            The prime minister would "work with whoever is the president of the United States and he is committed to maintaining the special relationship," the spokeswoman said.
