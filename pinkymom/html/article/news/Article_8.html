        <div class="modal_text">
            <p>Barack Obama has become the first serving US president to visit Hiroshima since the World War Two nuclear attack.</p>
            <p>
            Mr Obama said the memory of 6 August 1945 must never fade, but did not apologise for the US attack - the world's first nuclear bombing.

            </p>
            <p>
            Mr Obama spoke to two survivors and in an address called on nations to pursue a world without nuclear weapons
            </p>
            <p>At least 140,000 people died in Hiroshima and another 74,000 three days later in a second bombing in Nagasaki.</p>
            <p>
              'Best of friends'
            </p>
            <p>Mr Obama first visited the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum before walking to the Peace Memorial Park, accompanied by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
            </p>
            <p>
            Both men stood in front of the eternal flame. Mr Obama laid a wreath first, followed by Mr Abe.
