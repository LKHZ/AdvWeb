                Washington (CNN)Marco Rubio said he would consider running for re-election to the Senate if Florida's lieutenant governor, a close friend of his, had not entered the race to succeed him.

                Rubio, who said last year while he was running for president that he would not seek re-election, offered a new window into his thinking in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper set to air Sunday on "State of the Union."

                The likely Democratic and Republican nominees each have historically high unfavorable numbers. Media attention for the party, both the national committee chairman and the party's political director say, is at unprecedented levels.

                "Maybe," Rubio replied.
            </p>
            <p>"Look, I have a real good friend I've known for a long time who I was running for the Senate with. I didn't run. I said I wasn't going to. He got into the race," Rubio said. "I think he's put in time and energy to it and he deserves the chance to see where he can take it."

                Later Friday, a spokeswoman for Lopez-Cantera, Courtney Alexander, said the lieutenant governor wasn't stepping aside.
            </p>"It looks like the press needs a narrative going into Memorial Day weekend," Alexander said. "Carlos Lopez-Cantera is focused on winning this Senate seat, and Senator Rubio has been supportive of Lopez-Cantera's candidacy. I'll let that speak for itself."

                Chris Hartline, spokesman for businessman Carlos Beruff, who is also seeking the Republican nomination for the Senate seat, said his boss wouldn't drop out it Rubio jumped in.
