            <p>Can Trump make inroads with union voters?</p>
            <p>
         A seemingly growing rift between union members and other factions of the Democratic Party could present an opening this year for Donald Trump – the NAFTA-hating, border wall-building Republican populist – to peel off labor voters traditionally loyal to the other side.


            </p>
            <p>
            “There has been this disconnect between private-sector, white workers and the new Democratic coalition,” pollster Scott Rasmussen said, adding that unions are scrambling this year to “stop the hemorrhaging.”
            </p>
            <p>The latest evidence of a fraying Democrat-labor alliance came earlier this month, when billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer unveiled For Our Future PAC, a $50 million partnership with the AFL-CIO and public-sector unions designed to mobilize Democratic voters in key battleground states.</p>
            <p>
            The announcement exposed a sense of betrayal felt among some trade unionists which could redound to Trump’s benefit.
            </p>
            <p>Union presidents, in a letter to AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, charged that the AFL-CIO has “now officially become infiltrated by financial and political interests that work in direct conflict to many of our members” and “moved away from us and our membership in the interest of headline-grabbing political expediency.”
           </p>
            <p>
          
                Terry Sullivan, the president of the laborers union LIUNA, voiced his objection to “the political agenda of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. being sold to a job-killing hedge fund manager with a bag of cash,” according to a letter obtained by The New York Times.
