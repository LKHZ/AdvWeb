            <p>Scuffles have broken out between police and pro-democracy campaigners in Hong Kong during the visit of the most senior official from Beijing to go there since major protests in 2014.</p>
            <p>
             Zhang Dejiang, the leader responsible for Hong Kong affairs, arrived amid discontent with alleged interference in the territory's affairs by Beijing.

            </p>
            <p>
              Protesters were forced back from the residence of the territory's leader.

            <p>A heavy police presence surrounds the building, where Mr Zhang was due to have dinner on Tuesday night.</p>
            <p>
              AFP news agency reports that earlier, seven members of pro-democracy political party the League of Social Democrats were arrested after putting up protest banners. Three are still detained.
            </p>
            <p>A leading pro-democracy activist was also wrestled to the ground by police outside Mr Zhang's hotel, the agency adds.
            </p>
            <p>
            Mr Zhang said he was in Hong Kong "to listen to all sectors of society about what recommendations and requirements they have about implementing the principles of 'one country, two systems'".
            </p>
            <p>
            In a five-minute speech on arrival, Mr Zhang conveyed "President Xi Jinping's warm regards and well wishes for the people of Hong Kong" and said he came "with the care of the central government and all Chinese people".
