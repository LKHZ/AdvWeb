	<p>Megan Fox rules her refrigerator with an iron fist.</p>

	<p>As the “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” actress told Extra on Thursday, once estranged husband Brian Austin Green can never satisfy his sweet tooth under her roof.</p>

	<p>“He never gets to eat anything fun because my house is so clean and I make him eat really clean, too,” 30 year old Fox revealed.</p>

	<p>And while she and Green, 43, will be spending Father’s Day together with their two boys, Noah, 3, and Bodhi, 2, Fox admitted she might cave in the desserts department.</p>

	<p>“Maybe I’ll get him a German chocolate cake or something. He’ll be so happy to see junk food,” she said.</p>

	<p>While the pair nearly pulled the plug on their marriage when Fox filed for divorce last August, the couple have reportedly reconciled. Not only are they moving in together again, but they’re also expecting their third child.</p>

	<p>“I feel great. I love being pregnant, which is, a lot of women don’t feel that way, it is really uncomfortable… by the way, it is painful at parts,” Fox shared. “I feel the overall process is an amazing one. I feel so productive creating a human person that I’m so excited to meet because I know that I have such a spiritual connection to them, so I can’t wait to meet the newest member of my family.”</p>

	<p>Though Fox is keeping her due date under wraps, her eldest child is already gearing up for the new arrival.</p>

	<p>“The older one is very excited,” she said.</p>
