        <h1>Patent scandal: US outmaneuvered on UN agency investigation</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="modal_text">
            <p>In a bid to recover ground, U.S. diplomats, along with those from other nations that ostensibly oversee the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), an obscure but important U.N. agency in Geneva,  were negotiating furiously to see if they will ever get to read a report on alleged wrongdoing by the agency’s autocratic director general, Francis Gurry, accused among other things of ordering illegal break-ins of his own staffers’ offices.
            </p>
            <p>
         Gurry himself already has a copy of the full and unredacted report on his own misdeeds-- including the names of witnesses who testified against him—in violation not only of whistleblower protection rules but of standard U.N. investigative practices used to ensure witness cooperation.


            </p>
            <p>
          According to a  State Department spokesman, U.S. diplomats in Geneva were still demanding “immediate release” of the report—which WIPO’s 188 member states had ordered up themselves from the U.N.’s Office of Internal Oversight Services, and which was delivered to the chair of WIPO’s General Assembly in February.
            </p>
            <p>So far, the WIPO Chair—a Colombian diplomat named Gabriel Duque—has refused to hand over the document to his own membership.  But he did give a copy to  Gurry, an action that a U.S. State Department official told Fox News “falls far short of standard practices” for handling such sensitive documents.
            </p>
            <p>
          Ever since, U.S. and other concerned WIPO members have been scrambling, without much success, to catch up, while giving up negotiating ground in the process. On May 19, the concerned countries wrote a letter to Duque, demanding copies  of the sensitive report.  

            </p>
            <p>On May 26, the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, Pamela Hamamoto, joined other diplomats in meeting with Duque—who supposedly acts on behalf of all of them—to demand “immediate access” to the full report, in the words of a State Department official.
