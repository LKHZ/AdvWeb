                Hundreds of employees from media giant 21st Century Fox have opted to take buyouts as part of the company’s efforts to cut costs at its TV networks and film studio.
            </p>
            <p>
                The total number of people who accepted benefit packages to leave the company was 300 to 400, according to a person close to the company who declined to be identified discussing internal matters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Buyout offers were first announced in February to help the conglomerate cut expenses by $250 million. Job reductions mainly affect Fox’s West Coast offices in Century City.
