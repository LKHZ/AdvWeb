            <p>
         There’s no question that the post-Reagan order of red and blue states is not nearly as durable as the prognosticator class has supposed.


            </p>
            <p>
           Minnesota, for example, has gone Democratic in every election since 1972, but some of those Blue Team victories have been by 2 points or less. Or Texas, the bulwark of the modern GOP, has been red since 1980, but twice by less than 5 points.
            </p>
            <p>What remains to be seen is how much and how soon demographic trends could tip states one way or the other and – of more immediate interest – whether voter psychology could make for sudden and surprising shifts beyond the normal contours of demography.</p>
            <p>
           Based on his post-clinch comments Thursday and on a prior interview with the AP, presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump sees a 15-state general election battleground.
            </p>
            <p>The recent history has been that both parties start out with similarly long lists of target states and then shrink down to about the same seven or eight.

           </p>
            <p>
          
                Trump’s list includes some obvious ones – Ohio, Florida and Virginia – some that have been at times tantalizingly close but remained Democratic for a generation – Minnesota, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Maine – two that have been far, far out of reach for a long time – California and New York – plus at least one that hasn’t gone for a Democrat for 36 years – Georgia.
      
            </p>
            <p>
                That adds up to 11, and we could guess at the other four. But they would (or at least should) likely include some quartet drawn from among Iowa, North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada, New Hampshire and Colorado.
            </p>
            <p>
                This amounts basically to a list of places where Trump intends to hold rallies since, as David Drucker explains, the nominee intends to outsource the work of organizing and getting out voters to the RNC.
