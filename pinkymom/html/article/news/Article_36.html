		<p><b>Toby Jones is to play a villain in the fourth series of BBC One's Sherlock.</b></p>

		<p>Jones will join Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman in the second episode of the new three-part series. Filming began on Monday.</p>

		<p>Jones said: "I'm excited and intrigued by the character I shall be playing in Sherlock..."</p>

		<p>The show's co-creator Steven Moffat said: "Delighted to have Toby Jones on board, bringing to life one of Doyle's finest villains."</p>

		<p>Co-creator Mark Gatiss added: "We're thrilled to welcome one of our finest actors to the Sherlock family. I know Toby will embrace the part with true relish!"</p>

		<p>It was announced last month that series four will begin with Holmes (Cumberbatch) back on British soil, as Doctor Watson (Freeman) and his wife, Mary (Amanda Abbington), prepare for parenthood.</p>
