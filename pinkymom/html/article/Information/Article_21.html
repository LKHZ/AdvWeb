                The fashion rivalry between Paris and New York is as old as time (or at least fashion week), and designers Humberto Leon and Carol Lim are watching the battle play out from both sides.

                In New York, the duo rule over what's arguably the city's most buzzed-about independent boutique, Opening Ceremony, which they started in 2002 and have spun into a fully fledged fashion line with outposts in Los Angeles and Tokyo. And in last five years, they've brought new life to Kenzo as its creative directors, transforming a fashion house in decline, into a commercially viable, streetwise brand that dominates both the street style blogs and department store floors. "I think it's a luxury to be able to work in two amazing cities," said Lim from Opening Ceremony's New York headquarters. "The places are all different, but the actual experiences are very similar."

                We caught Leon and Lim between shows to find out what it's like to work, live, and find inspiration in the world's style capitals. Humberto Leon: Language is a huge one! Did either of you speak French before you moved? Oh, and the produce is better! The fruits and vegetables, the ingredients for food on a pure level. Everything tastes like it's supposed to taste. It almost tastes fake.
