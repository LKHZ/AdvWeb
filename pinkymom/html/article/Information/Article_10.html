                Award-winning funnyman Bob Newhart has finally sold his 1.37-acre Bel Air estate in California for $14.5 million, Variety says.

                The 1941 French country -- style mansion, which has been on and off the market for about three years, includes 9,000-plus square feet of living space. It features five bedrooms, six bathrooms, and a step-down living room with vaulted ceiling and fireplace. The home also has a lovely, lagoon pool with waterfall.

                Newhart purchased the house in 1990 for $4.2 million, records show. He originally put it on the market for $15.5 million.

                Newhart, who has a Grammy, Golden Globe, and Emmy in his trophy room, is a comic actor and writer arguably best known for a duet of long-running TV sitcoms cleverly titled, "The Bob Newhart Show" and "Newhart." In 2013, he won his first prime-time Emmy for four guest appearances on "The Big Bang Theory."

                Now 86, the deadpan comedian still performs to sold-out crowds around the country.
