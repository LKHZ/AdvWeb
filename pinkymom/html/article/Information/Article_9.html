        <h1> Quintessential Los Angeles: Modern Masterpiece by Rodney Walker </h1>

                It doesn't get more L.A. than talking to luxury agent and TV personality Dani Behr about a Rodney Walker-designed house in Bel Air, CA, while she maneuvers her car through the Hollywood Hills. The Mid-Century Modern residence is currently on the market for $1.8 million.
            </p>
            <p>
                "It's very quintessential L.A.," says the British expat, who has appeared in "Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles." She lavished praise on the Mulholland Drive address, '50s-era design, and "sick views."
            </p>
            <p>
                She adds, "I'm originally from London. When I think of an L.A. home, this is what I think of." Which is no surprise, because the designer definitely had an influence on the residences of Southern California.
            </p>
            <p>
                Walker designed and built hundreds of modern homes, including Case Study Houses #16, #17, and #18. In 1956, he moved to Ojai, CA, where he continued his practice until retiring in 1971.

            <p>
                This looker located at the top of a private drive was built in 1950 and served as Walker's personal home for a brief time. The current seller, a composer originally from New York, lived "happily" in the home for about a decade but has decided to move back East, the agent notes.
            </p>
            <p>
                While there have been some updates, including marble counters and new appliances in the kitchen, and new tiling in the bathrooms, the layout and the Mid-Century Modern vibe are unchanged.
            </p>
            <p>
                And then there's that view. "The view is the thing, the pice de rsistance, the selling point of the house," Behr says.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other selling points of the 1,700-square-foot abode include the iconic open concept living spaces, walls of glass with a 280-degree vista, and a high-pitched roof that was "quite cutting-edge for the time."
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally three bedrooms, one has since been converted into a den. Also included are two bathrooms, a "cook's kitchen," and a wood-burning fireplace.
            </p>
            <p>
                "His work is timeless," Behr adds. "That's why people live in L.A. This is not Nebraska."
            </p>
