                Ann Arbor is an artsy college town -- home to the University of Michigan -- so this modern, luxe property fits right in. Listed for $6.95 million by Elizabeth Brien of The Charles Reinhart Co., the nearly 10,000-square-foot home on 4.5 acres went on the market this month.

                Owned by Toys R Us CEO Dave Brandon, it was his residence while serving as president and CEO of Domino's Pizza as well as the University of Michigan's athletic director. In fact, he and his family (the home's only owners) had a hand in its design, which took three years and was completed in 1998. Inspired by a trip to Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater in Pennsylvania, the architect dubbed this masterpiece "Ever After."

                The crown jewel of this six-bedroom home, which also has seven full bathrooms and five half-baths, is that you can see Barton Pond from every room. There's also an elevator, multiple terraces, sunroom, chef's kitchen, theater, billiard room, wine cellar, and outdoor pool. A creek runs through the property, and the gated entrance leads to a brick-paved circular driveway. Did we mention the seven-car garage?

                "It's truly an unmatched property -- there's never been anything like this," says Brien, pointing to the quality materials, including a slate roof, concrete floors, plus an abundance of steel and glass. "It's the best views in southeast Michigan. And I've seen a lot of houses."

                The perfect buyer may be a nature buff as well as an entertainer. "It's designed for comfortable living, for family gatherings," says Brien, "and you can entertain about a hundred people."
