        <h1> April breaks global temperature record</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="modal_text">
            <p>April was the seventh month in a row that broke global temperature records, Nasa figures show.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last month smashed the previous record for April by the largest margin ever, the data show.
            </p>
            <p>
                That makes it three months in a row that the monthly record was broken by the largest margin ever.

            </p>
            <p>But in terms of its departure from the 1951-1980 temperature average used by Nasa, April was equal with January 2016.
            </p>
            <p>February and March this year showed greater departures from the norm.
            The new record for April trounced the previous one, set in 2010, by 0.24C.
            "The very unfortunate circumstance we have now is the overlap of a very intense El Nino that has been magnified by climate change," said Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>
