        <h1>Microsoft is giving up on its Chinese web portal</h1>

            <p>Microsoft is killing off its web portal in China.

            </p>
            <p>
             The tech giant said its MSN website in China -- which provides news and lifestyle content as well as a search function -- will be shut down on June 7.
            </p>
            <p>
             Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) remains "deeply committed to China," the company said in a statement, noting that the country hosts its biggest R&D facility outside the U.S. and is a market for products like Windows 10 and cloud computing services.

            </p>
            <p>
           A spokesman didn't respond to questions about the reasons behind the decision to close the Chinese MSN site.

            </p>
            <p>Microsoft has repeatedly hit roadblocks in China, a key market where it's made big bets. The company has been embroiled in an antitrust investigation in China since July 2014. In January, regulators asked it to explain "major issues" related to the probe.</p>
