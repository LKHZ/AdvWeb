        <h1> Consumer Reports' top smartphone: Samsung's Galaxy S7</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="modal_text">
            <p>It looks like seven is Samsung's lucky number. Consumer Reports just named the Samsung Galaxy S7 the best smartphone it has ever reviewed. The S7 Edge was named its second best.

            </p>
            <p>
           Similar to our own experience with the phones, Consumer Reports found the devices to have great cameras, excellent battery life, super-fast processors, and very high resolution screens.

            </p>
            <p>
          The expandable storage and water-resistance features also helped the phones gain their top ratings, partially because they make the other parts of the phone stand out even more.

            </p>
            <p>
         For example, the phone can record video in 4K, or Ultra-HD. Those files are huge in size, which makes it important to have a microSD slot for memory cards.
