                Last week, the area’s most famous supermodel resident, Gisele, celebrated the mass-market launch of her coffee table book, Gisele Bundchen. To get ready for an event this big, she called in her A-team. That includes makeup artist Rose-Marie Swift.

            <p>
                Swift, a NYC-based makeup artist and entrepreneur who founded the organic makeup line RMS Beauty, has been working with Gisele since the supermodel was 15 and just starting out in the industry. Twenty years later, she’s still her go-to makeup guru.

                Below are four summer makeup tips, straight from the woman who touches Gisele’s face on the regular.

                <h3>1. Get glowing</h3> Last year’s “strobing” buzzword is just a marketing term created by Big Makeup to sell luminizers, and people have taken it way too far, Swift said. There’s no need to go overboard; a little luminosity goes a long way.

            <p>
                “What I’m loving right now is that this whole luminizer thing has really taken off, and people are getting it,” Swift said. “Seeing the skin with an extra glow with a luminizing effect is gorgeous. ‘Strobing’ was really just a flash in the pan, and it was too much. You don’t want to look like a disco ball. Trying a luminizer is a more wearable version of that.”

            <p>
                <h3>2. Don’t stop at your face</h3> Luminizer isn’t reserved only for the face, but you also shouldn’t be piling on the body shimmer. There’s a fine line between night club and strip club, Swift said. Pro tip: Try a dab of shine across your knuckles and down the center of your shin.
            </p>
            <p>“Add luminizer on selected areas of the skin like the top of your shoulders and across your knuckles,” Swift said. “These are subtle things I’ve done on shoots. Putting a little shimmer on your knuckles makes the light catch your hand when you’re holding up your cocktail.” Also, applying luminizer down the front of your legs—just one small line down the shins—will make legs appear longer and thinner, Swift said. But beware of overdoing it: Putting shimmer all over your thighs will actually make them look bigger, she said.</p>

                <h3>3. Brows are still big </h3> Fortunately, one ’90s trend that has stayed firmly in the past is super-skinny, over-tweezed brows. While Gisele used to ignore her brows completely, they now fill them in a bit for more fullness and definition. “We now make a stronger impact on [Gisele’s] eyebrows,” Swift said. “For years we wouldn’t add any definition to them because she has great eyebrows. We fill them in a bit now, even in summer, for a more modern, darker brow.”
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>4. Balance is key</h3> It’s summer! Step away from the contour kit. Swift said that there’s no need to be in full makeup all day. There’s a reason why the advice your grandma gave you about makeup (either play up your eye or lip, not both) has stood the test of time. “We don’t always have to have full-on makeup everyday, especially in summer,” Swift said. “A strong brow and a swipe of mascara with a bold lip or a done up eye and a nude lip will look much more fashion-forward than a full face of makeup. It’s a trade off.”
