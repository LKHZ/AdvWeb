                French artist Daniel Buren has turned the Fondation Louis Vuitton into a giant kaleidoscope for his latest installation, Observatory of Light. The 3,600 sheets of glass that make up the outer sails of the 2014 building -- designed by Frank Gehry -- now have an extra colorful coating, which filters the light entering and bouncing off the structure. Reflections inside the space will change in form depending on the time of day and the season. Bernard Arnault, president of the Fondation Louis Vuitton, described the Observatory of light as "a real dialogue with Frank Gehry and his building."

                '[Buren's] work responds magnificently to the architecture, in line with his approach, going back to the 1970s, that sees a coming together of colors, transparency and light,' he added. From 28 May, children's workshops will run alongside the installation, aiming to engage them with color, light and opacity. In early June, there will also be three performances of 3 times a Hut, a theatrical experience Buren created in collaboration with circus stars Dan and Fabien Demuynck.
