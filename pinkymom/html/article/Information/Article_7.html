                From grass-covered pyramids to Bauhaus-inspired residential blocks, heterogeneity was at the fore at the fourth annual Architizer A+Awards.
            </p>
            <p>
                The web-based architecture platform received thousands of entries from more than 95 countries, with awards across 113 categories, as voted for by a panel and over 400,000 members of the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                Proving that good design can elevate just about any building, the list of awardees for the Jury Prize and People's Choice Winner included everything from crematoriums in Hong Kong to safari lodges in Botswana, urban high rises to chapels buried deep in the woods.
            </p>
            <p>
                Among the architects to win are Bohlin Cywinski Jackson, Rafael de Cardenas and the late Zaha Hadid for her Messner Mountain Museum Corones in Italy. "This year we are expanding the fame, creating an even wider set of categories, celebrating the buildings and structures that impact our world," explains Architizer CEO Mar Kushner.
