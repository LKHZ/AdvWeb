        <h1>DNA from ancient Phoenician stuns scientists</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="modal_text">
            <p>A study of the first DNA obtained from an ancient Phoenician reveals that the man had European ancestry.
             </p>
            <p>
         The research team, which was co-led by Professor Lisa Matisoo-Smith of the University of Otago in New Zealand, sequenced the first complete mitochondrial genome of 2,500-year-old Phoenician buried in North Africa. Experts studied a man dubbed the “Young Man of Byrsa” or “Ariche,” whose remains were taken from a sarcophagus in the ancient city of Carthage, just outside Tunis, the Tunisian capital. Carthage was the center of the Phoenician civilization.
             </p>
            <p>
        Analysis shows that the man belonged to a rare European haplogroup – a genetic group with a common ancestor – indicating that his maternal ancestry is linked to locations on the North Mediterranean coast, probably on the Iberian Peninsula.
