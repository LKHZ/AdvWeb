        <h1>Amazon's Echo Dot packs the soul of the Echo in a shorter package</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="modal_text">
            <p>Amazon has taken its popular voice-controlled Echo speaker and decapitated it. The squat new Echo Dot lost a built-in music speaker, but added the ability to commandeer your existing sound system.

            </p>
            <p>
            Amazon's Echo is a speaker crossed with a Siri-like voice assistant named Alexa who's always listening, waiting for your spoken commands. Since being released in late 2014, it's gone from an oddball gadget with a niche audience to a surprisingly powerful home control-center that anyone can enjoy.
            </p>
            <p>
           Still matte back and cylindrical with a blue ring of light, the 1.5-inch high Echo Dot doesn't make any design innovations. The main speaker is gone, but so is half the price tag. The Dot costs $89, while the Echo is $179.

            </p>
            <p>
          The Dot still includes a small speaker for the usual Alexa communication, although it isn't meant for music -- it's on par with a smartphone on full blast.

            </p>
            <p>But it includes a sweet new trick that makes up for the speaker downgrade: The Dot can connect with third-party speakers over Bluetooth or the included AUX cable. That means you can turn your existing home audio system into an Alexa speaker.</p>
