        <h1> 'Smart leg' makes engineering prize shortlist</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="modal_text">
            <p>A "smart" prosthetic leg is one of three finalists for the MacRobert Award, a major UK engineering prize.
            </p>
            <p>
               Made by Basingstoke firm Blatchford, the Linx Limb uses a network of sensors to adapt to changing conditions by adjusting its robotic knee and foot.

            </p>
            <p>
               Also on the shortlist are Jaguar Land Rover, for building its own innovative engines, and Siemens Magnet Technology, for pushing the boundaries of MRI scanning.

            </p>
            <p>The shortlist was announced on Monday.

            </p>
            <p>The MacRobert Award, organised annually since 1969 by the Royal Academy of Engineering, will be presented for 2016 at a dinner on 23 June.</p>
            <p>
                Each of the three nominees would "have a positive impact on millions of people and bolster the UK economy", said the chair of the judging panel Dame Sue Ion.
            </p>
            <p>
               "It's often said that Britain doesn't make anything anymore, but these three companies are proof that the opposite is true, and testament to the world-leading engineering innovation that happens here in the UK," Dame Sue said.
                "Each of this year's finalists has taken a different approach to innovation - from sustained incremental improvements to starting from scratch."
