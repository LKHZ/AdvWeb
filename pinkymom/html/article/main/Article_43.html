	<p>Amber Heard accusing Johnny Depp of domestic violence, according to multiple media reports. </p>

	<p>The actress turned up in court on Friday with a bruise on her face, according to TMZ. Heard presented the court with photos of her with bruises, TMZ reports.</p>

	<p>TMZ posted a photo of Heard with marks around her eye. The site reports the image was snapped Saturday night, after Heard says Depp hit her in the face with his iPhone.</p>

	<p>According to multiple media reports, Heard was granted a temporary restraining order against Depp.</p>

	<p>A rep for Depp did not immediately return FOX411’s request for comment on the domestic violence allegations.</p>

	<p>Heard filed for divorce from Depp earlier this week, citing irreconcilable differences in her filing. The couple was married just 15 months. They met on the set of the 2011 flick “The Rum Diaries.”</p>

	<p>After news of their divorce became public, a lawyer for Depp told news outlets, "Given the brevity of this marriage and the most recent and tragic loss of his mother, Johnny will not respond to any of the salacious false stories, gossip, misinformation and lies about his personal life. Hopefully the dissolution of this short marriage will be resolved quickly."</p>
