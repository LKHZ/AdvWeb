                This summer, the National Museum of Scotland is receiving the most dramatic face-lift in its 150-year history.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Edinburgh institution is set to open 10 new galleries, comprising 3,000 of the 12 million objects in its collection, as part of an Â£14.1 million ($20 million) plan to rejuvenate the gallery and position it as a major player on the world stage. Among the exciting additions -- 75 percent of which haven't been seen for generations -- are rare pieces from the museum's extensive fashion collection. Ahead of their July 8 unveiling, Georgina Ripley, Curator of Modern & Contemporary Fashion & Textiles, guides us through the most visually stunning and historically impressive garments hidden in the museum's archives.
