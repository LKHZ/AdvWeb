                Keryn Redstone said she was aligning with Viacom Inc. Chief Executive Philippe Dauman’s legal battle against Sumner Redstone, 93, and his daughter, Shari Redstone, which is scheduled to begin to play out in a Massachusetts court on Tuesday.

                Sumner Redstone’s side is expected to make a motion to move the legal proceedings to Los Angeles, where Sumner Redstone lives, according to a person familiar with the matter.
