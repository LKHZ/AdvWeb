	  <p> Meghan Trainor experienced a performer’s version of hell on Thursday. The Nantucket native performed on The Tonight Show, the night before her new album, Thank You, dropped. She sang and danced her way through her new song “Me Too,” only to wipe out right at the end of her song as she reached for the microphone. There she lay on the stage floor, out for the count in her sparkly dress.</p>

	  <p>It’s totally good, though. Trainor tweeted that she’s feeling fine, and she Instagrammed her thanks to Fallon for having her on the show, writing in a caption: “Might have fell down… but I KILLLED that sh? hahaha #keepinitreal.” Crushed it.</p>
