	  <p><b>'The Accountant' set to hit theaters next fall.</b></p>
	  
	  <p>Math may now have a superhero, thanks to an upcoming film starring Ben Affleck.</p>

	  <p>The trailer for The Accountant was released on Thursday, giving audiences a first glimpse at the upcoming action movie. It tells the story of a math savant who works as a small-town CPA to cover up the fact that he’s a “freelance accountant for some of the world’s most dangerous criminal organizations,” according to the movie’s official website. That’s right: Affleck portrays a sexy, brooding, risk-taking accountant.</p>

	  <p>The film also stars Anna Kendrick, J.K. Simmons, and Jeffrey Tambour, and is slotted to release October 14.</p>
