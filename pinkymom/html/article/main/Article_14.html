                It may be 13 years since Calvin Klein left the fashion house he founded, but the brand is still using his sex sells advertising ethos.

                With one difference. They've added a hashtag. In 2014, the brand launched its #mycalvins campaign. Enlisted were some of the world's most relevant and influential celebrities: Canadian singer Justin Bieber, model and reality TV star Kendall Jenner, rapper Kendrick Lamar, and hip hop star Fetty Wap, to name a few.

                They were instructed to post pictures of themselves in Calvin Klein underwear, with the caption "I ___ in #mycalvin." Something suggestive normally filled in the blank. "I think the Justin Bieber thing is brilliant," Calvin Klein, 73, tells CNN Talk Asia. "He's right on. Perfect for now. And Kendall Jenner has a huge following."

                <h3>The power of social</h3> "Social celebrities" are those with huge clout on platforms such as Facebook, Vine and Instagram. Bieber, for example, has 64.8 million followers on Instagram, while the official Calvin Klein account has 4.3 million. As these influencers posted raunchy images of themselves in their Calvins, the public began to copy. Today, the #mycalvins hashtag has been used 362,000 times, with the award-winning campaign touted as one of the most successful uses of social media in advertising. "It was clear in our new hyper-voyeuristic world that everyone wanted everyone else to see what (social celebrities) were up to in their underwear," says Courtney Blackman, founder and managing director of leading London-based fashion public relations agency Forward PR.
