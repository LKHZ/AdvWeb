	<p>Actor Mark Wayne Salling was charged Friday with receiving and possessing child pornography on his computer and flash drive, according to a federal indictment obtained by Fox News.</p>

	<p>A federal grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Salling, 33, of Shadow Hills, Calif., alleging that he had been in the possession of several videos and at least one still image depicting child pornography in December 2015.</p>

	<p>Salling was best known for playing Noah “Puck” Puckerman on the television program “Glee.”</p>

	<p>Federal agents previously seized a laptop computer, hard drive and USB drive from Salling’s home at that time. The Los Angeles Police Department originally arrested Salling on state child pornography charges and released him on bond. However, after further investigation into the scope of the allegations against the actor, federal authorities were notified.</p>

	<p>“Young victims are harmed every time an image is generated?every time it is distributed, and every time it is viewed,” U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker said in a statement.</p>

	<p>Salling’s attorney said the actor will surrender to federal authorities on June 3 to face the charges, according to a Department of Justice news release.</p>

	<p>“It doesn’t matter who you are or what you do, if you hurt a child you will be held accountable, LAPD Lt. Andrea Grossman, commander of the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, said.</p>

	<p>Salling was sued in 2013 by a woman who claimed he forced her to have sex without a condom. Salling denied the sexual battery charge and the case was settled.</p>
