            	<p>Calvin Harris may be mending a broken heart as well as a wounded face after his Los Angeles car accident, as People reports that Harris and pop superstar Taylor Swift have parted ways after 15 months of dating.</p>
	<p>The two haven’t been spotted together in recent weeks and Swift remained mum after Harris, whose real name is Adam Wiles, was involved in a car accident causing him to cancel performances while he recovered from injuries.</p> 
	<p> "There was no drama. Things just don't work out sometimes," an insider told People.</p>

	<p>The couple celebrated their one-year anniversary on March 6, sharing photos with fans on social media. Swift posted an Instagram photo of a vintage-looking trinket engraved with the date.</p>


	<p>"Taylor and Adam had no big blowout fight, but the romance just was not there anymore for them,” a source told E! News on Wednesday. </p>

	<p>“Adam is the one that ended it. It was all done in a very mature fashion. Taylor is pretty upset but they are still in communication. Taylor was there for Adam with his accident and supportive."</p>

	<p>The couple parted ways last week, according to reports.</p>

	<p>Swift, 26, spoke a little about her tumultuous love life in a 2015 interview with Glamour UK, where she admitted being “jaded” by relationships thanks to media scrutiny that shamed her for her dating life.</p>
     
	<p>“What else is it when you have two boyfriends in one year and everyone's calling you boy crazy, making jokes about you at awards shows?” Swift asked. “That's public humiliation. And I don't think it's fair.”</p>

	<p>Harris becomes the latest in a long string of famous Taylor Swift ex-boyfriends, including Joe Jonas, Jake Gyllenhaal and Harry Styles. </p>

	<p>For Swift, time heals all wounds. And if history is any indicator, the songstress will soon be taking the lemons of this heartbreak and crafting them into multiplatinum record lemonade.</p>
